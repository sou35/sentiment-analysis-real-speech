# sentiment-analysis-real-speech
In this project, we are going to analyze the sentiment of Speech . We are first going to convert the speech to text and then analyze the sentiment using TextBlob. TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.
NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.

The project is called sentiment Analysis of Speech. The goal of the project is to analyze the sentiment of Human Speech. First, the user has to speak something . The application takes multiple snaps of the user and then stores it into the database. Once the same user comes before the camera again, the application captures the image, references it against the already stored images in the database, and then marks the attendance, if the user is present in the database. Reports can be generated for a particular duration based on the user requirement.
